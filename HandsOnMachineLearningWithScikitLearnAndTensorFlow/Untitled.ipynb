    "A recurrent neuron looks just like a normal feedforward neuron except it also has connections pointing backwards.\n",
    "At each *time step t* (or *frame*), a recurrent neuron receives the inputs $\\textbf{x}_{(t)}$ as well as its own output from a previous time step, $\\textbf{y}_{(t-1)}$.\n",
    "Thus, each neuron has two sets of weights, $\\textbf{w}_x$ and $\\textbf{w}_y$.\n",
    "These inputs and weights get multiplied together and passed to an activation function just like for a feedforward network.\n",
    "The following function is for a layer of recurrent neurons at a time frame $t$ where $\\phi$ is the activation function and $b$ is the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{y}_{(t)} = \\phi(\\textbf{W}_x^T \\textbf{x}_{(t)} + \\textbf{W}_y^T \\textbf{y}_{(t-1)} + b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the initial value of $\\textbf{y}$ at $t=0$ is set to 0.\n",
    "It is common to see a recurrent neuron displayed across the time axis - this is called *unrolling the network through time*.\n"
