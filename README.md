## Sources

To begin, I am working through [
Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do).


## Creating the environment

I am using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.7, downloaded from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
I created a virtual environment for this repository called "daysOfCode-env".

```bash
conda create --name "daysOfCode-env" python=3.7
```

After that, I needed to initialize conda for `zsh`.

```bash
conda init zsh
```

After that, I could activate the virtual environment.

```bash
conda activate daysOfCode-env
```


## Log

**Day 1 - October 21, 2019:**
I got Anaconda installed, my virtual environment set up, and began working through Python for Data Analysis (PDA).
I am also just getting used to VS Code.

**Day 2 - October 22, 2019:**
I am getting more confortable with VS Code and Jupyter notebooks.
I continued working through PDA and learned about some of the basic Python types.

**Day 3 - October 23, 2019:**
I learned about control flow in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
I also covered tuples and lists.

**Day 4 - October 24, 2019:**
I learned about dictionaries, sets, and comprehensions.
